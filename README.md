# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: In naked twins technique we just have to find two equal numbers of length 2 from a unit.Now we know that these 2 numbers belongs to only those 2 boxes,but we dont know which number belongs to which box.But we can use this constraint to solve our sudoku.We can eliminate those two numbers from other boxes of that unit which will ofcourse reduce our problem and makes it easier to solve.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: For this sudoku problem we got an extra constraint,that is the main diagonals must have all numbers [1,9] appear only once.This actually adds two units to our unit_list.Those units are [['A1','B2','C3','D4','E5','F6','G7','H8','I9'],['I1','H2','G3','F4','E5','D6','C7','B8','A9']].We can now use this contraint to make our problem more easier.We can from now do elimination and apply only choice techniques to this unit as well.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solution.py` - Fill in the required functions in this file to complete the project.
* `test_solution.py` - You can test your solution by running `python -m unittest`.
* `PySudoku.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the `assign_value` function provided in solution.py

### Submission
Before submitting your solution to a reviewer, you are required to submit your project to Udacity's Project Assistant, which will provide some initial feedback.  

The setup is simple.  If you have not installed the client tool already, then you may do so with the command `pip install udacity-pa`.  

To submit your code to the project assistant, run `udacity submit` from within the top-level directory of this project.  You will be prompted for a username and password.  If you login using google or facebook, visit [this link](https://project-assistant.udacity.com/auth_tokens/jwt_login) for alternate login instructions.

This process will create a zipfile in your top-level directory named sudoku-<id>.zip.  This is the file that you should submit to the Udacity reviews system.
